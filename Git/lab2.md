# Lab 2 - Remote Repositories

Create an empty public repository named *gitworkshop{name}* to your GitHub account. Connect your local repository to the remote repository. Check the tracked repository. Push your local commits to the local repository.

Clone the remote repository to a different local directory. In one local folder, create new commits. In the other folder fetch and pull changes. 
Invite the GitHub members of your team and the user *christiannagel* to your repository.

Use these commands:

* git remote
* git push
* git fetch
