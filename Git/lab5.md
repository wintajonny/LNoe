# Lab 5 - Forking and Pull Requests

Create a new public repository named {name-shared} in your GitHub account with a readme file and a license, and include a gitignore. Inform the other course attendees about this repository, but don't add them as collaborators.

To inform the attendees about this repo, add a link to the repo to this file: [lab5-repos.md](lab5-repos.md)

Fork a repository from other course attendees (at least from the team you're working with, but you can use other repos as well) to your own GitHub account. Clone your remote repository. Create a new branch and create commits. Push the commits to your forked remote repository and create a pull request to a new branch in the forked repository.

As you receive pull requests from other course attendees, approve changes as long as they don't conflict with your guidelines.
