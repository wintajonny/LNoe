# Lab 8 - Undoing things

* In one of your repositories, change the last commit message
* Add a file to the last commit which you missed adding
* Change a file in your repository without adding it to the staged area and restore it
* Create two new commits and then remove the last two commits from your repository. Verify the log.
* Make changes in the remote repository while you also change the same files in your local repository. Try to pull the changes from the remote repository. Use *git stash* to keep your changes besides. After a pull, get back your changes from the *stash*
* Experiment with other options to change commits, change files in the working tree and the index.
