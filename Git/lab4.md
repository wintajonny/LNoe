# Lab 4 - Branching

Create a **develop** branch with your repository. Create commits both in the *main* branch as well es the *develop* branch. Try to avoid making conflicts. Merge changes from the *develop* branch to the *main* branch. Push changes to the remote repository.

Create more commits in the *main* and *develop* branches. This time, make changes in the same files with different commits. What happens with a merge? How can you resolve conflicts? Push changes to the remote repository.

Use these commands:

* git branch
* git switch
* git log
