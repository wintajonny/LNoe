2. Create a finalizer and implement the IDisposable interface
3. Create an outer class that contains the inner class, and implement a finalizer as well in this outer class
4. Use the outer class and a) release it after usage with the using declaration, and b) don't release it. Is ths Finalizer invoked? When?
